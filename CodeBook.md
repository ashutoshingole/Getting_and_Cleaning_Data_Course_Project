## This CodeBook explains the "R" code in "run_analysis.R" file and all variables and data in "average.txt" file.

### run_analysis.R
This file contains the actual "R" code written for this project.

1. This part reads and merges the training data and test data as required.

2. This part extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. This part uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. This part appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
